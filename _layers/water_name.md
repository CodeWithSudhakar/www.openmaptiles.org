# water_name

Lake center lines for labelling lake bodies.
This is based of the [osm-lakelines](https://github.com/lukasmartinelli/osm-lakelines) project
which derives nice centerlines from OSM water bodies. Only the most important lakes contain labels.

## Fields

### name_en

The english `name:en` value if available.

### name

The OSM [`name`](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:name) value of the water body.

### class

At the moment only `lake` since no ocean parts are labelled. *Reserved for future use*.
