# building

All [OSM Buildings](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Buildings). All building tags are imported ([`building=*`](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:building)). The buildings are not yet ready for 3D rendering support and any help to improve
this is welcomed.

## Fields

### render_min_height

An approximated height from levels and height of the bottom of the building or building:part after the method of Paul Norman in [OSM Clear](https://github.com/ClearTables/osm-clear). For future 3D rendering of buildings.

### render_height
