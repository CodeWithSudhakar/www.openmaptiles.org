## Terms of use for the free pre-generated OpenStreetMap vector tiles

We love the open-source and open-data community. Our OpenStreetMap vector tiles are free for:

- open-source and open-data community projects
- non-commercial personal projects
- evaluation and education purposes

<br>
For any other use, there are two ways how to apply OpenMapTiles maps in your project: 

1) Generate the vector tiles yourself, just follow our [documentation](/docs/).
Consider the time necessary for the task and the required infrastructure costs (e.g. generating the planet 
on Amazon may get you a bill for up to a thousand dollars)

2) Purchase [World production package](https://openmaptiles.com/production-package/) or [Area extract](https://openmaptiles.com/extracts/) which includes:

 - the right to use our prepared OpenStreetMap data packages in your products
 - derived from latest OpenStreetMap data
 - global hill shading raster tileset
 - global contour lines vector tileset
