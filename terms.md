## Terms of use for free pre-generated tiles

We love the open-source and open-data community. Our OpenStreetMap vector tiles are free for:

- open-source and open-data community projects
- non-commercial personal projects
- evaluation and education purposes

<br>
For any other use,  there are 2 ways, how to apply OpenMapTiles maps in your project: 

1) Generate your own tiles, just follow our [documentation]. Consider the time 
necessary for the task and infrastructure costs (e.g. generating the planet 
on Amazon may get you a bill for up to a thousand dollars)

2) Purchase "World package" or "Area extract" which includes:

 - curated ready-to-use map tiles for your products
 - legal rights for production use of the tiles
 - no need for visible "OpenMapTiles" attribution
 - extra hill shading
 - extra contour lines
 - always latest OpenStreetMap data
