    <p>OpenMapTiles is a project simplifying installation of free world maps powered 
      by OpenStreetMap. It offers freely downloadable OSM vector tiles, and a set of 
      open-source tools for use and generating of the maps.</p>

    <p>Within minutes anybody can run on a laptop or private server his own instance 
      of a zoomable OpenStreetMap map, with a customised design and use it in websites 
      and mobile applications or in intranet - even behind a firewall or without 
      internet connection.</p>

    <p>The open-source project is the result of the bachelor thesis of Manuel Roth and 
      Lukas Martinelli from the University of Applied Sciences Rapperswil, Switzerland 
      supported and made possible by Klokan Technologies GmbH.</p>

    <p>A open-source workflow for producing vector tiles from OpenStreetMap data is 
      publicly available and documented. Everyone can adapt the workflow to create 
      their own custom vector tiles. The workflow is scalable across multiple hosts 
      and the produced vector tiles are compatible with Mapbox Streets. Because the 
      vector tiles are available as download it is possible to create an offline 
      version of OpenStreetMap for Desktop and Mobile. This will provide new 
      possibilities for mobile developers that want to create applications that need 
      a local state of the art map.</p>

    <p>For cartographers this project enables the possibility to create maps that donâ€™t
      depend on any third party service and system administrator can setup 
      infrastructure without needing to know the internals of optimizing PostgreSQL 
      and Mapnik.</p>
