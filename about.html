    <p>OpenMapTiles is a project simplifying installation of free world maps powered 
      by OpenStreetMap. It offers freely downloadable OSM vector tiles, and a set of 
      open-source tools for use and generating of the maps.</p>

    <p>Within minutes anybody can run on a laptop or private server his own instance 
      of a zoomable OpenStreetMap map, with a customised design and use it in websites 
      and mobile applications or in intranet - even behind a firewall or without 
      internet connection.</p>

    <p>The open-source project is the result of the bachelor thesis of Manuel Roth and 
      Lukas Martinelli from the University of Applied Sciences Rapperswil, Switzerland 
      supported and made possible by Klokan Technologies GmbH.</p>

    <p>For cartographers this project enables the possibility to create maps that donâ€™t
      depend on any third party service and system administrator can setup 
      infrastructure without needing to know the internals of optimizing PostgreSQL 
      and Mapnik.</p>
