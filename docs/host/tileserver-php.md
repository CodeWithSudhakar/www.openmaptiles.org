In case you wish to publish vectortiles, there is no need server hosting or 
expensive cloud for server that are hard to install and maintain.

There is an alternative, TileServer-PHP, which is open-source project
written in PHP. TileServer-PHP is implementing OGC WMTS standard for pre-rendered 
raster tiles but it can serve vector tiles as vell. It is distributed with build 
in JavaScript client which can display vector tiles in testing X-Ray viewer.
